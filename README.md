# Webscraping weather data

## Opgavebeskrivelse
This project is meant to be a group exercise and the scope is 4 working days. The requirements are as follows:

Choose a website that provides some interesting data that you can scrape daily.
Scrape the data from the website and using JSoup.
Enrich the data by fetching additional information from a REST API.
Store the data in a database using JPA.
Write unit tests for scraping, enrichment, and API reading logic using JUnit.
Use DTOs to represent the data.
Use as many of the concepts you have learned as possible as functional programming, streams, lambdas, generics etc.
Share the source code on GitHub.
Write documentation for the project and add to your repo.

### Vi skal have lavet underst책ende i dag - Mandag.

Day 1: Web Scraping and DTOs

Choose a weather website to scrape daily weather forecasts.
Use Jsoup to scrape the weather data for a specific location and date.
Create a DTO class (e.g., WeatherDTO) to represent the weather data.
Extract relevant weather data such as temperature, humidity, and conditions and map it to the DTO.

### Vi skal have lavet underst책ende til Tirsdag.

Day 2: Enrichment, API Reading, and Unit Testing

Implement logic to enrich the scraped weather data using a weather API (OpenWeatherMap API) and add additional - - data/info regarding geographical destinations

https://dawadocs.dataforsyningen.dk/dok/api/sted

or
https://vejr.eu/pages/api-documentation

Create a Java class (e.g., WeatherApiReader) to interact with the API and fetch additional weather information.
Write unit tests for scraping, enrichment, and API reading logic using JUnit.

### Vi skal have lavet underst책ende til Onsdag.

Day 3: JPA Setup and Entity

Set up a local database (PostgreSql) for storing weather data.
Create an entity class (e.g., WeatherEntity) to represent the data in the database.
Use JPA annotations to map the entity to the database schema.
Implement a JPA DAO interface for the weather entity, with methods like: getAll, getYesterday, update(LocalDate date) etc.
Write test for the JPA DAO.
Write code to convert the enriched DTO data into the JPA entity.
Save the enriched weather data to the database using JPA repository methods.

### Vi skal have lavet underst책ende til Torsdag.
Day 4: Finalize and Document

Refactoring

Complete testing, ensuring all components work cohesively.
Fine-tune your code, refactor, and optimize where necessary.

Documentation

Write documentation including EER Diagram, links and names of the used api's and pages that are used for web scraping
Consider edge cases, error handling, and potential improvements.
Prepare a presentation to demonstrate your work for the review on friday
